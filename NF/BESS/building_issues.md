**Sometimes, when building bess, it will prompts errors like cannot find function of dpdk..., most of the case, this kind of issue is resulting from errors in environment settings.**

One possible solution is to determine if the DPDK environment variable is set correctly. (e.g. ```RTE_SDK```, ```RTE_TARGET```)
