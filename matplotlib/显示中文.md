There are two types of method of displaying Chineses character in Plots. But only the one using font manager is workable on my platform

```python2
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# Must specify the source code encoding at the begining

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.font_manager as mfm

...
fontP = mfm.FontProperties()
# If the font is not system-wide installed, the path of the font file should be specified. 
# fontP = mfm.FontProperties(fname='/Library/Fonts/XXX.ttf')
plt.rcParams['axes.unicode_minus'] = False
fontP.set_family('Adobe Heiti Std') # It is recommended that using this one is more nice looking. 
...
plt.ylabel(u"中文y标签", fontproperties=fontP)
plt.xlabel(u"中文x标签", fontproperties=fontP)
```
